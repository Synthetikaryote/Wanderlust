properties
    the world is divided into lots
    your character starts off in an auto-generated property that you own.  there will be a small house on it with some basic needs.  you are welcome to adapt it
    you'll start with 2 property slots.  one is already filled by the one you start with.  you can go out into the world and claim an unclaimed lot.  claiming a lot takes 24 hours.  during claiming, you can build on it, but it doesn't make your inventory safe and nor can you spawn on it.  if a monster touches your lot, claiming is canceled and is unclaimable by you for 5 minutes, and 10 minutes by other players
    lots being claimed should have a faint transparent white pulse
    after 24 hours, the lot is yours and becomes one of your properties
    if a monster destroys all of the structure on your property, it returns to the world and is unclaimable by you for 5 minutes, and by others for 10 minutes
    as you "level up"?, you gain more property slots, to around 5 in total.
    you can abandon properties you own by removing all structure from it, freeing one of your property slots
death penalty
    whenever you return to one of your properties, all your inventory is automatically made safe
    whenever you're out on an excursion, new items you acquire are not safe
    if you die, you respawn at your nearest property.  a tombstone appears where you died and any items that are not safe are in a chest by your tombstone.  this chest can only be looted by you and lasts 7 real life days
    (if you have no properties, where do you spawn?  maybe you always have your starting property?  maybe there's an indestructible town center somewhere?)
